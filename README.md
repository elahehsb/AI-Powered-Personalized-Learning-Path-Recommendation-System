# AI-Powered-Personalized-Learning-Path-Recommendation-System

#### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered system that recommends personalized learning paths for students based on their performance, learning style, and preferences. The system will analyze student interaction data from various sources, including online courses, quizzes, and assignments, to provide tailored educational content and improve learning outcomes.

#### Project Goals
##### Data Collection and Integration: Collect data from Learning Management Systems (LMS), online quizzes, assignments, and student feedback.
##### Data Processing and Analysis: Process and analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights and patterns.
##### Machine Learning: Develop and train machine learning models to predict student performance and recommend personalized learning paths.
##### User Interface: Create an interactive web-based interface for students, educators, and administrators.
##### Deployment: Implement scalable and efficient deployment using containerization and orchestration technologies.

#### System Architecture
##### Data Collection: Collect data from various educational platforms.
##### Data Storage: Store the data in a scalable and flexible NoSQL database like MongoDB.
##### Data Processing: Use Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and Apache Spark for processing and analysis.
##### Machine Learning: Train models using libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
##### User Interface: Develop the UI using modern web technologies like React.js and Flask.
##### Deployment: Use Docker and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.
